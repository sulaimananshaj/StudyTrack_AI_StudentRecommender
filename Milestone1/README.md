# Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing and EDA

## Objective
Clean, preprocess, and analyze student data to identify study patterns affecting performance.

## Dataset Source
Student Performance Dataset (UCI/Kaggle)

## Steps Followed
1. Loaded and checked dataset
2. Handled missing values and duplicates
3. Fixed data types and encoded categorical variables
4. Split dataset into two tables: students and study_logs
5. Performed descriptive analysis (summary statistics, correlation, outliers)
6. Conducted EDA with 4+ visualizations

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Key Insights
- Higher study time leads to better grades
- More failures and absences lead to lower grades
